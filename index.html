      <h3>My thoughts</h3>

      <h5 id="one">Rags to Riches</h5>
      <p> This song embodies the journey I like to think I'm on. It has a smoth ride from strat to finish with great story telling</p>

      <h5 id="two">Good Drank</h5>
      <p>With a chorus that will have you singing along by the 2nd time through 2 chainz has done it again</p>

      <h5 id="three">Heart on Ice</h5>
      <p>This song is how I need to b. After so much hurt i need to just chill out. Jjst stay present and not try to do or say anything</p>

      <h5 id="four">Bop</h5>
      <p>I put this song into the mix to shake things up a bit. It has a lot of bounce so get ready to bob your head</p>

      <h5 id="five">What you know about love</h5>
      <p>This is more of a tribute to Pop Smoke I didn't lsten while he walked with us.</p>

      <h5 id="six">Toes</h5>
      <P>I needed to add some street songs in the mix as well. Gotta to have the trap music<p>

      <h5 id="seven">In God I Trust</h5>
      <p>There is a lyric that goes God sat me down, broke me down, now go make me proud.This is all i want is to make the most out of myself. To make mysef proud of the work I have put in.</p>

      <h5 id="eight">So a Child may Follow</h5>
      <p>This is a track that will have you hitting repeatto take in the gravity of Damian Marley's words.</p>

      <h5 id="nine">Tombstone</h5>
      <p>Just when you speak on my name just make sure you say the truest in the mother sucking game on my tombstone.</p>

      <h5 id="ten">Life is Good</h5>
      <p>Instant classic from the released date unitl now. It's still grooving till today.</p>

      <h5 id="Eleven">Walk Em Down</h5>
      <p>Finishing off with the energy needed to finish off the day.</p>
